## Description
NYC Restaurant Inspection Results is a dashboard that enables users to find restaurant inspection results in each zip code. Makers in red indicate restaurants that have a critical flag, and a detailed description of the violation can be found on the tooltip when you hover over the marker. On the accompanying pie chart, you can find the percentage of the restaurants among those displayed that have the critical flag. Since the dashboard only displays a maximum of 1,000 restaurants, users can click “Prev” or “Next” to display additional restaurants in the selected zip code.
